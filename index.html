					<p class="caption">I love hay bales. Took this snap on a drive through the countryside past some straw fields.</p>
					<p class="caption">The lake was so calm today. We had a great view of the snow on the mountains from here.</p>
					<p class="caption">I hiked to the top of the mountain and got this picture of the canyon and trees below.</p>
					<p class="caption">It was amazing to see an iceberg up close, it was so cold but didnâ€™t snow today.</p>
					<p class="caption">The red cliffs were beautiful. It was really hot in the desert but we did a lot of walking through the canyons.</p>
					<p class="caption">Fall is coming, I love when the leaves on the trees start to change color.</p>
					<p class="caption">I drove past this plantation yesterday, everything is so green!</p>
					<p class="caption">My summer vacation to the Oregon Coast. I love the sandy dunes!</p>
					<p class="caption">We enjoyed a quiet stroll down this countryside lane.</p>
					<p class="caption">Sunset at the coast! The sky turned a lovely shade of orange.</p>
					<p class="caption">I did a tour of a cave today and the view of the landscape below was breathtaking.</p>
					<p class="caption">I walked through this meadow of bluebells and got a good view of the snow on the mountain before the fog came in.</p>
